# NEX Technical Interview
 NEX Technical Interview Submission
Description:
This is my Technical Interview Submission for NEX Labs, this is just a prototype of a boss rush game idea I had in mind for a long time. In this prototype you will face the first boss of the whole game you have to use your wit and look for openings to attack the boss. You should also be sure to stay in cover and attack at the right time. Watch out for the bosses special attack.

How To Play The Game:
First extract the .zip file to find the executable for the game
Run the Executable.
You can find a Main Menu for the game to start playing it

Controls For The Game:
WASD to move the player ( The Movement is done in Isometric view )
Space key to Dodge ( The dodge is more like a jump, I've decided to implement dodge to match my Design of the game and to make it more fast paced. The Dodge detects collisions so player does not phase through walls of obstacles )
Left Mouse Button to Shoot ( Player will shoot infinite bullets )

Bonus Implementation :
The whole prototype was focused to show off the power of dependency injection in Unity so I used Zenject to inject dependencies and Followed MVC pattern for all the scripts. 

Known Issues or Bugs:
Game doesn't have a jump but it can be implemented. 
Game UI can be more well made
Game Scripts can be well coded
There aren't any game breaking bugs as of now.
